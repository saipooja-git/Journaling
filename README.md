📝 My Diary – A Full-Stack Journaling App


Login page built with Bootstrap and gradient styling

🚀 About the Project

I built My Diary as a personal journaling application where users can:

Register and securely log in

Write daily journal entries

View and manage posts in a personal feed

Delete or revisit older posts on a dedicated page

The goal was not just to create a simple CRUD app, but to practice end-to-end full-stack development — from authentication and database integration to UI design and deployment.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MySQL

Authentication: bcrypt (secure password hashing)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Deployment: Vercel (frontend) & Node.js backend
